PZ BLOODCURE 2.0
- I've taken over a mod I loved by Starman who originally took it over from someone else.
- With this release it's easier to get samples, no need to pickup corpses anymore. 
- The cure is somewhat easier to make. Instead of 100 zombies, you only need 25.
- Other than the cure you can also use zombie corpses/meat for compost/fertilizer.
- Or you can eat it and die. Your choice!

Details Surrounding the Cure:

The Zombie Infection spread through Knox County more swiftly than most anticipated. While the human population was nearing a fast extinction a group of Knox County doctors miraculously came up with a cure. While it appeared human civilization still had a chance, unfortunately the cure required some effort on those wanting it. There was no over the counter doses. Capturing and putting down zombies to extract special flesh components was not easy and many perished but it was the only way. Still while most of civilization is gone, you now have that chance to find the research papers left behind and begin towards building yourself some temporary protection from the infection. Temporary because this cure only will heal you from the initial infection. Any subsequent bites or injuries leading to infection will require a new cure.

Research Papers and the Procedure:
The procedure listed in the research papers was more detailed than expected, noting in many places to be extremely careful and extract blood from approximately 25 zombies from regions of the arms, legs, torso and head. Not just a poke and run thing though! Requiring a knife or similar cutting apparatus to propery cut into the flesh and extract zombie flesh from the right locations. Now apparently, with the collection of zombie flesh one then extracts a precise amount of blood from the collected flesh. Note this gruesome but needed process consumes the dissected zombie. Things get easier here, once the 25 samples are all combined into a flask. Cure is made. Now the next worse thing to death. Consuming the cure. With little other research there is no known side-effects.

Other Tips:
Remember the cure only works for 1 infection. This means you need to have another if you get infected again!
Anything cure related will be found in medical places. Medical storage. It's been known some survivors have made copies of the research material and put it on other magazine stands around Knox County in the hope that others may find it!

So don't give up hope! There is a chance yet that you will continue to survive the Apocalypse! With a bit of work!

Raw details
-----------
boxes of 50 syringes

flask + testtube + 25 samples = Blood cure

I'd like to give credit to the original author of PZ BloodCure, Starman. As well as the author of DissectCorpse mod. A great mod that hasn't been updated in over 2 years which had code I needed. I hope the author does not mind.
